Fifty-six clubs have competed in the Bundesliga since its founding. Bayern Munich has won the title 30 times, the most among Bundesliga clubs.

The Bundesliga was founded in 1962 in Dortmund[4] and the first season started in 1963. The structure and organisation of the Bundesliga, along with Germany's other football leagues, have undergone frequent changes. The Bundesliga was founded by the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (English: German Football Association), but is now operated by the Deutsche Fußball Liga (English: German Football League).
